# Context Document: Goodwill Central Texas Referral Generation AI Tool

## Organizational Overview

Goodwill Central Texas operates comprehensive workforce development and career advancement programs serving clients across a 17-county region in Central Texas, including Travis (Austin), Williamson (Round Rock, Georgetown, Cedar Park), Hays (San Marcos, Buda, Kyle), and 14 additional counties (Bastrop, Blanco, Burnet, Caldwell, DeWitt, Fayette, Gillespie, Gonzales, Lavaca, Lee, Llano, Mason, and others).

The organization functions as a Community-Based Organization (CBO) delivering grant-funded training and support services to job seekers, veterans, youth, and individuals facing barriers to employment. Goodwill Central Texas is a distinct entity from other Goodwill organizations and operates its own programs and policies.

- Ongoing support throughout their career journey

**Critical Note for AI Tool:** Most staff users' clients are already enrolled in the Workforce Advancement Program. Avoid recommending general career coaching services they're already receiving. Focus on specialized training programs, specific workshops, or additional support services.

- Provide realistic timelines with specific dates when possible
- Identify specific next steps with responsible parties clearly named
- Offer multiple contact methods for follow-up questions
- Anticipate common questions (time commitment, transportation, childcare)

### Addressing Barriers Proactively
Case managers should identify and address common barriers:
- **Transportation:** Bus passes, gas cards, carpooling options
- **Childcare:** Assistance during training hours, Excel Center on-site childcare
- **Technology Access:** Computer and internet access for virtual classes or homework
- **Basic Skills Gaps:** CAT courses, remedial education, or Excel Center referral
- **Financial Concerns:** Living expenses during training, support services available
- **Documentation Challenges:** Missing records, expired IDs, assistance obtaining documents
- **Time Conflicts:** Work schedules, family obligations, program flexibility options

## Program Integrity and Compliance

All programs must maintain:
- Accurate attendance tracking for grant reporting
- Timely case note documentation (within 24-48 hours of contact)
- Strict compliance with grant requirements and deliverables
- Proper approval workflows without shortcuts
- Confidentiality of client information (HIPAA, FERPA when applicable)
