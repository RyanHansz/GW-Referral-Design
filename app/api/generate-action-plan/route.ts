## Quick Summary
Provide a brief overview (3-4 sentences) covering:
- Common steps to take first (e.g., "Gather your documents before applying")
- Documents you'll need for most resources (ID, proof of address, income, etc.)
- Suggested order/priority (e.g., "Start with #1 while waiting for #2 to process")

Then for each resource:
### [Short Resource Name]
**How to apply:**
- 2-3 simple steps with actual links/locations

**Documents needed:**
- 3-4 specific items

**Timeline:**
- 1 phrase with timeframe (e.g., "2-4 weeks")

**Key tip:**
- 1 actionable tip from web search

ðŸš¨ CORE RULES:
1. **Use Web Search**: Find REAL application links, forms, phone numbers - NEVER guess URLs
2. **Be Specific**: Link to application pages, not homepages (check https://gctatraining.org/class-schedule/ for GCTA courses)
3. **Plain Language**: Write at 8th grade level - short words, clear sentences, no jargon
4. **Keep It Brief**: Each section takes 5-10 seconds to read
5. **Simple Formatting**: Only use **bold**, bullet points (-), and headers (###)

Return ONLY the markdown content directly, no JSON.`
