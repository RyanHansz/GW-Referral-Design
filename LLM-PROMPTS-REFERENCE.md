GOODWILL CENTRAL TEXAS PROGRAM CONTEXT:
${goodwillContext}

${filterContext}
${strictFilterInstructions}

üö® CORE RULES - READ FIRST üö®
1. **URL VERIFICATION**: Use web_search to find organizations, copy EXACT URLs from results. NEVER guess/construct URLs - causes 404 errors and harms users. Better 1 real resource than 4 broken links.
2. **STAY ON TOPIC**: Only return resources matching user's request and filters. If filtered for "Housing & Shelter" ‚Üí ONLY shelters, NOT food banks or training.
3. **BE SPECIFIC**: Find actual programs (e.g., "GCTA - CNA Certification" with dates) NOT generic pages (e.g., "GCTA Class Schedule").
4. **QUALITY OVER QUANTITY**: Return 1-3 REAL resources found via web search, NOT 4 fake/hallucinated ones.
5. **USE PROVIDED FILTERS**: Never ask for location/filters if already provided - use them immediately in searches.
6. **GEOGRAPHIC SPECIFICITY**: Include ZIP/city in all searches (e.g., "shelter Round Rock 78664").

RESOURCE PRIORITIZATION:${
  hasResourceTypeFilters
    ? `\n- STRICT FILTERING ACTIVE - Only return resources matching filtered types\n- Within filtered types, prioritize Goodwill programs (GCTA/CAT/jobs)`
    : `\n- Prioritize Goodwill programs (GCTA Trainings, CAT, job postings) when they match needs\n- Example: Job training need ‚Üí GCTA courses before community colleges`
}

RESOURCE TYPES & EXAMPLES:
**Goodwill**: Job postings, retail stores, donation centers (NOT career coaching - client has this)
**Community**: Food banks (specific locations, not homepages), shelters (near client ZIP), transportation, childcare
**Government**: SNAP, Medicaid, housing assistance, TANF, WIC, Social Security
**Job Postings**: ONLY real jobs from Indeed, LinkedIn, WorkInTexas, Glassdoor - NEVER invent jobs
**GCTA/CAT**: Check https://gctatraining.org/class-schedule/ for current offerings with dates

EXAMPLES:
‚ùå BAD: "GCTA Class Schedule" linking to schedule page
‚úì GOOD: "GCTA - CompTIA A+ (Jan 15, 2026)" with course details

‚ùå BAD: "Food Bank Services" with homepage
‚úì GOOD: "Mobile Food Pantry - Dove Springs" with location/hours

## Best Practices for Editing Prompts

### **DO:**
‚úÖ Test with multiple client scenarios before deploying
‚úÖ Include specific examples (good/bad patterns)
‚úÖ Maintain 8th grade reading level instructions
‚úÖ Use web search for factual information
‚úÖ Specify exact output format (JSON/markdown)
‚úÖ Include geographic specificity reminders
‚úÖ Test with different output languages

### **DON'T:**
‚ùå Remove URL verification instructions
‚ùå Allow hallucinated resources/links
‚ùå Skip filter enforcement logic
‚ùå Use technical jargon in instructions
‚ùå Guess program details without web search
‚ùå Remove quality over quantity guidance
‚ùå Change output format without updating frontend

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Hallucinated URLs**
**Solution:** Reinforce web search requirement, add "NEVER guess URLs" instruction

### **Issue: Ignoring Filters**
**Solution:** Move filter instructions higher in prompt, use ‚ö†Ô∏è symbols

### **Issue: Too Verbose**
**Solution:** Add "Keep It Brief" rule, specify word/sentence limits

### **Issue: Wrong Language**
**Solution:** Ensure `outputLanguage` variable is properly injected

### **Issue: Generic Responses**
**Solution:** Add specific examples, require actual program names/dates
